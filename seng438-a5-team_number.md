# Introduction

The main purpose of this lab was to help us discover the reliability assessment and the usage of the tools such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart with the help of Excel. This lab assignment also explored the failure reliability growth testing which helps analyze the product’s changes over a period of time. Additionally, this lab also introduced to us the concept of failure data which is critical to analyze as it can aid us in determining how to prevent future failures. Overall, these new concepts solidified the theoretical lectures helped us understand where reliability testing plays its role in software testing procedures.
